# maintainable code document

## for make the app I use de following tips for make maintainable code 

- Declarative code: Several functions are placed that make processes that at
first glance you know what it does, but not how it is done.

- Comments: Comments are added within the functions and throughout the code to 
make the code more understandable.

- Naming conventions: The "snake_case" variable naming convention was respected, 
so that the code remains consistent.

- Modulate the application: The application is separated into modules, 
in which each one performs a specific action, so that if a change needs to 
be made, it will not affect the other modules.
